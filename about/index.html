                <h1> What is Formula 1 Wiki?</h1>
                <p>The Formula 1 Wiki is a website for an informatics school project.</p>
                <h1>What is the objective of Formula 1 Wiki?</h1>
                <p>The main objective of the website is to create a user-friendly and accessible way to access information about the motorsport. It will contain all important statistics about the drivers, teams, standings, seasons, etc. that are not available on official Formula 1 websites and/or Wikipedia pages. Even though all statistics are obviously available on the internet, they are not in one central location. This website tries to bring the information from all over the internet and bring them into one place, making it not necessary to go to several different websites when researching the motorsport.</p>
                <h1>What is Formula 1?</h1>
                <p>Formula One, also known as F1, is a type of open-wheel motorsport that began in 1950. Races, commonly called Grand Prix, are held around the world on dedicated circuits and street circuits. </p>
                <p>Many of the world's top car manufactures are currently competing in Formula One. The car can reach speeds of up to 360 km/h (225 mph), is equipped with a turbocharger and revs at up to 13,000 rpm. F1 races are usually 305km (190 miles) long and last about an hour and a half to two hours.</p>
                <h1>Why Formula 1?</h1>
                <p>Formula 1 isn't a show of art it's a show of engineering. It makes the ground rumble and your ears ring. Formula 1 makes you feel alive. At 13,000 rpm, this is a cry of science, not music. This is the inner surface of the pneumatic valve spring, which has mean effective pressure and 300 horsepower per litre displacement. Find the perfect 4-stroke V6 naturally aspirated engine. And in the middle of the hot metal is carbon, which is an alloying technology made of meat and blood. The coolest head rises from its carbon fibre monocoque. These are eyes that slow down and can identify faces from the crowd as if they were not blurred at 300 km/h. It is pure mathematics of angle and aerodynamics, physics of G-force and friction, and pure racing instinct. These are masters of speed and engineering.</p>
                <p>The passion me and many other fans share about this motorsport is sometimes misunderstood as too complex or “just cars driving around in circles”. With this website I allow those who don't know much about the sport to be able to get some insight into the history and culture of Formula One.</p>
                <h1>Who is the target audience for this website?</h1>
                <p>This website can provide information for both diehard Formula One fans and people who are unfamiliar with the sport. The website is easy to understand and use even for the most recent fans of the sport with no knowledge of it. The navigation structure is self-explanatory and doesn't leave the user wondering where to find the information. Most pages end up leading to one another, so a user can find the information it wants or needs wherever he thinks the information is, as there is no predefined “path” to find said information.</p>
