                <h1> What is Formula 1 Wiki?</h1>
                <p>The Formula 1 Wiki is a website for an informatics school project.</p>
                <h1>What is the objective of Formula 1 Wiki?</h1>
                <p>The main objective of the website is to create a user-friendly and accessible way to access information about the motorsport. It will contain all important statistics about the drivers, teams, standings, seasons, etc. that are not available on official Formula 1 websites and/or Wikipedia pages. Even though all statistics are obviously available on the internet, they are not in one central location. This website tries to bring the information from all over the internet and bring them into one place, making it not necessary to go to several different websites when researching the motorsport.</p>
